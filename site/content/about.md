### This blog is a place for me to openly document and wrestle with ideas.

<br/>
I'm frequently engaged with all sorts of ideas. But handling it only in my mind, and mostly on my own has made these ideas fleeting and cloudy.

To have a better grip on these ideas using this blog as a medium, I hope to achieve two things:

* Better formulation and organization of these ideas in a coherent manner by documenting it with a post
* Expand the development of these ideas through inviting feedback and different perspectives by engaging with comments on the post

By posting, I aim to represent what I think and where I'm at with these ideas. By pursuing this aim, I hope you can be made aware of what I'm wrestling with, so that you can wrestle with it too and dialogue with me so we can learn more together for the benefit of all.

So, please think about what I write and leave a comment or email/message me directly!

Glory be to God.
