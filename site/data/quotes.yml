quotes:
  - quote: "The paradox is that constraining your own actions with a moral code actually increases your sovereignty as opposed to simply following impulses and desires. This is because with morality you can rationally choose how to act in spite of neurochemical, psychological, and social influences which many people cite as proof that free will doesn't even exist."

  - quote: "Right thinking comes with self-knowledge. Without understanding yourself you have no basis for thought; without self-knowledge, what you think is not true."
